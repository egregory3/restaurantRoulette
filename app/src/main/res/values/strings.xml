    <string name="Rules">The Rules are simple: You and your significant other, your family, or your friends need to find somewhere to eat and no one is doing a good job of picking a place.  Restaurant Roulette is your solution.
    Each member of your group agrees to let a spin of the restaurant wheel decide where you eat tonight.  Restaurant will search restaurants in your area and return a randomly chosen option.  Enjoy your meal and hopefully find a new favorite.</string>
